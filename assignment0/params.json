Much of mine had to do with calculating the lines that make up the edges of the square and testing the mouse's position with respect to those lines. I found Prof. Guy's approach much easier, so I implemented that instead. I still struggled a little bit with rotation, but eventually found some help from a [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2259476/rotating-a-point-about-another-point-2d).\r\n\r\nAnother piece I had trouble with was smoothing out the transition when a user clicked inside the square, but not its center. Specifically, I was having trouble figuring out how to redraw the screen after each intermediate point was calculated. I abstracted away the screen redraw logic into its own function and called that from the `mouseClicked` function.\r\n\r\n## Extra Features\r\n- Pressing space will change the color of the square\r\n- `square-wide` and `square-narrow` binaries are also provided, which implement the square in a wide and narrow window. Dynamic window resizing does not work however.\r\n\r\n## Program Source\r\n[Source code](https://github.umn.edu/huhnx025/csci5607-assignment0/archive/v1.0.zip)\r\n\r\n[Mac Executables](https://github.umn.edu/huhnx025/csci5607-assignment0/releases/download/v1.0/square-mac.zip)\r\n\r\n[Linux Executables](https://github.umn.edu/huhnx025/csci5607-assignment0/releases/download/v1.0/square-linux.zip)\r\n\r\nCompile with:\r\n```\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun with:\r\n```\r\n./square\r\n```\r\n",
